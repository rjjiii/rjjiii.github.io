Below are some of the software projects that I've started or maintained. 

## Interval Tool

Time sampling is pretty difficult but I hope this tool helps. Behavioral therapy or applied behavioral analytics (<abbr>ABA</abbr>) requires a _lot_ of data collection. Most of the clients are in therapy to improve limited communication abilities, so behavioral therapy treats all behavior as communication to be recorded. Some methods are straight forward like duration, but I found time sampling to be especially difficult because of how split my attention was. This tool combines an interval timer with 2 clickers or counters, and uses visual color prompts whenever data should be recorded.

Privacy is important, so **all** of the data is saved _within the browser_ and will not be shared, viewable, or accessible online. Nothing will be saved to your device beyond what the browser stores. The tool is free and open-source software available under the [Open Software License version 3.0](https://rjjiii.com/license/). Source code is currently availabe by right-clicking the browser window. In the future, a repo will be made publicly available.

## K-Meleon Extensions

[K-Meleon](http://kmeleonbrowser.org) is a lightweight open-source web browser that still **supports Windows XP**, Windows Vista, legacy processors, and limited RAM computers. It's a project that continues to breathe life in older machines. You can find extensions for K-Meleon that I maintain at the K-Meleon tools hub:

- [K-Meleon Tools Hub](https://rjjiii.com/K-Meleon/) with links to all extensions.
- [AdBlock Classic](https://rjjiii.com/K-Meleon/AdBlockClassic/) with one-click install from K-Meleon.
- [PDF Viewer](https://rjjiii.com/K-Meleon/K-PDF/) with one-click install from within K-Meleon.
