## K-Meleon Extensions

[K-Meleon](http://kmeleonbrowser.org) is a lightweight open-source web browser that still **supports Windows XP**, Windows Vista, legacy processors, and limited RAM computers. You can find extensions for K-Meleon that I maintain at the K-Meleon tools hub:

- [K-Meleon Tools Hub](https://rjjiii.com/K-Meleon/) with links to all extensions.
- [AdBlock Classic](https://rjjiii.com/K-Meleon/AdBlockClassic/) with one-click install from K-Meleon.
- [PDF Viewer](https://rjjiii.com/K-Meleon/K-PDF/) with one-click install from within K-Meleon.
