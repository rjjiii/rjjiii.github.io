The <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/OSL-3.0">Open Software License 3.0 (<abbr>OSL</abbr>)</a> is an <a href="https://opensource.com/resources/what-is-copyleft">open-source copyleft</a> license, which allows content to be <strong>freely reused and remixed</strong> so long as it remains under the <abbr>OSL</abbr>. If you are not planning on either modifying or distributing content, there are no limits.</p>

<h2>Why use this license?</h2>
<p>
Hand-crafted open-source license are often written by the very people and projects that use them. Some of these are honestly pretty fascinating. For 
example, the <a href="https://blitiri.com.ar/p/bola/">Buena Onda License Agreement</a> in addition to some standard terms of usage also provides advice on how to improve your community by helping the neighbors paint their house. That sounds wholesome, but I'm not sure if it's something to put into a legal document, which brings me to an important point:
<p>

<p>
I am not a lawyer, at all. <a href="http://www.rosenlaw.com/rosen.htm">Lawrence Rosen is a lawyer</a> who specializes in the intersection of computers and intellectual property, and he wrote the <abbr>OSL</abbr> while working as counsel for the Open Source Institute (<abbr>OSI</abbr>). The <abbr>OSI</abbr> has peer reviewed and approved many open-source licenses. Here are some of the core benefits I see of this one in particular:
</p>

<ul><li>Software and text are both covered. Many licenses target either art (Creative Commons) or software (<abbr title="GNU Public License">GPL</abbr>). This license can cover both, so there's no need to worry about how 2 separate licenses interact.</li>
<li><a href="#f_1" id="s_1">Copyleft is a way to keep things open.<sup>1</sup></a> All open-source license provide similar benefits by lifting some restrictions of copyright law. They each allow their audience to legally reuse, remix, and improve the work. Copyleft takes this a step further by keeping those new improved projects open as well. 
<li>Web apps are explicitly covered by the copyleft elements. Some open-source licenses emerged when software was more directly distributed by disk, download, or even paper. The <abbr>OSL</abbr> came out years after the emergence of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000310013159/http://www.businessweek.com/1999/99_46/b3655048.htm">early web apps and cloud storage.</a></li>
<li>Attribution is built into the language of the <abbr>OSL</abbr>. It provides a highly flexible way to <a href="#f_2" id="s_2">preserve notices and disclaimers only within the source code.<sup>2</sup></a> The actual program/document can be built in any way, and messages can be preserved for future creators.</li></ul>


## What content is covered?

Anything that is explicitly "Licensed under the Open Software License version 3.0" is covered by its terms. All rights are reserved unless otherwise stated. Pages on this site with open content contain an explicit statement at the bottom of the page along with links to <strong>source code</strong>. Any material made available under the Open Software License will come with some type of source code that enables remixing and reusing.

<li id="f_1"><a href="#s_1" aria-label="Jump up.">&uarr;</a>A copyleft license allows someone who receives a work to remix and share it, so long as they do so under the same license, thereby giving recipients the same benefits they originally received. The Free Software Foundation (<abbr>FSF</abbr>) <a href="https://www.fsf.org/news/2009-05-cisco-settlement.html">created a legal precedent for copyleft via defending their own General Public License.</a> The <abbr>FSF</abbr> took American tech corporation Cisco System to court in 2009 for violations, and that same year won case in France thereby creating an international legal foundation for copyleft.</li>
<li id="f_2"><a href="#s_2" aria-label="Jump up.">&uarr;</a>Some of the earliest open-source licenses used in academia like those from Berkley and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology require downstream software to provide attribution to the original creators and disclaimers of liability. Because these licenses did not require the distribution of source code, they mandated that these attributions had to be visible to end users. When Berkley created an <a href="oreilly.com/openbook/opensources/book/kirkmck.html">open-source license for their Berkley Software Distribution  (<abbr>BSD</abbr>)</a> in 1989 it even required notices to be placed in advertisements which was still far more open than proprietary software licenses. Today a <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php">simpler BSD-style license</a> is widely used, to reduce this attribution burden. Licenses that requires source code distribution can pass along notices to future creators that do not have to be visible for end users.
