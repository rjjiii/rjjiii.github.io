Hello,

I write fables, articles on technology, essays on the mind, documentation for open-source software, and sometimes if I'm being honest just downright lies. I've worked as a freelance writer, developer, instructor, and behavioral therapist over the past decade.

## More

I graduated from Lousiana State University (<abbr>LSU</abbr>) _summa cum laude_ with a degree in English, and I had intended to kind of go into my educational and work background in this section but did you know that LSU has 2 entire underground networks of secret passages, which is odd because in south Louisiana it's rare to even dig a basement, but the university was originally built on swampland, so the tunnels were not exactly dug but rather the state carved a massive drainage network in stone upon the swamp land, then stacked the second hidden layer of steam tunnels on top of that, and finally built the university itself obscuring all the tunnels into urban legend where every freshmen gets to hear some story about ghosts deep down in the tunnels especially in that one subterranean windowless classroom with the single schooldesk which is admittedly creepy but something you'll find with most ghost stories is that the myth obscures a horror even more difficult to face than the supernatural which is why they in general are so connected with death which nobody at least so far as I have ever known is prepared to deal with but in the deep south there is also that bonus horror of the legacy of white supremacy which depending on who you talk to can be even harder to speak on than death itself.
