		The style sheet with no media query is a foundational base for the the

		the display of content. The "styles" sheet is the primary style sheet 
		for the site. It contains both large and small screen layouts, plus

		contains modification that make the small style sheet from the main

The theme was space and I created <a id="s_1" href="#f_1">a story about tiny space soldiers fighting dinosaurs.<sup>1</sup></a> A haze of light rain at the fair turned the ground into a field of mud. To keep the space stories safe from the elements there were displayed inside the fieldhouse. iOur cosmic stories were juxtposed with snorting hogs.

<p class="noted_p"><strong>My grandmother raised me</strong> when I was a little boy. I can only really remember her through that lens, through eyes of five year old.

Even when she smoked, lighting each cigarette with glowing ruin of the last one,<sup class="note"></sup> she told me stories. When the sun went down it would be just us on the porch. The ember of her cigarette, a few rectangles of light flung out through the windows, and the stars in the distance. She’d point them out to me and say things like, <mark>"You see that star.</mark> That ain’t no star. Watch it shine."

When I was five lllllamma<code>llll<mark>lama</mark>two things</code> happened that changed the relationship I had with my grandmother. First, she died. That was the big one. It’s hard for me to remember this right, but I think it took me a long time to realize that she was stuck dead. I think, and I’m ashamed of this, that I tried to comfort my father by telling him she’s probably only be dead for a little while and then she’d be back on the porch smoking.

	<p>
	No one remembers the worst game ever made. We don't remember the games that are purely awful; we remember the games that fail spectacularly. Amidst a grey sea of interactive flash ads and licensed LCD key chains, occasionally something truly terrible rises ominous from the waves of normalcy.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is frequently regarded as the worst game ever. The financial collapse of Atari Inc and the 1983 crash of the entire North American video game market are blamed on E.T. It's completely unfair of course. (&hellip;)</p>
