<div class="home_excerpt">
<p>My unicorn was too anxious to leave the bedroom, and the vacuum cleaner was only making it worse. Every time I pushed the vacuum in his direction he would rear up onto his back hooves. There were less stained glass animals back here than in the rest of the apartment, but the unicorn had shuffled around and knocked his horn against the few owls that still dangled from the ceiling. They were all arcing on their taut chains, and brown bird-shaped stains scurried along the walls. He reared up so high that his horn punched into the ceiling, which was painted in mashed potato swirls that he had peppered with holes, so I gave up cleaning. I clicked the vacuum cleaner off and caught an owl as it swung near my head. Veins of metal branched through the beer-colored glass. I pulled my hands back slowly to let the owl sway gently in the air. I asked the unicorn, “You happy now?”</p>
